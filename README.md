# AccursedPlay

Reimaginging the Accursed Play gauntlet in Wizard101 as a point and click adventure game. 
It will probably be pretty much a prototype as I only have a week to make this :)

My main goal is to focus on mechanics.
This is supposed to be an intersection between Wizard101's combat mechanics and the format of a point and click adventure game.
